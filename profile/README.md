Golem Base is a Layer 2 Network deployed on Ethereum, acting as a gateway to various Layer 3 DataBase Chains (DB-Chains).

Built as an open, trustless, permissionless, and serverless platform, Golem Base is designed to enable cost-efficient data management within Web3 while maintaining the familiar Web2 database interaction standards, such as query languages.

* Extendable Data Availability Layer
* Aligned with Ethereum Ecosystem
* Composable, Versatile & User-controlled

## 🚀 Proof of Concept is Live

You can now explore what Golem Base is all about.  
We've shipped our first working PoC — it’s minimal, open, and ready to be hacked on.

### 🛠️ Get Started with the CLI

👉 **[golembase-demo-cli](https://github.com/Golem-Base/golembase-demo-cli)**  
The CLI connects to our public test PoC endpoint — no local setup needed. Just install and start experimenting.

### 🐳 Prefer Local Development?

Spin it up in minutes with Docker:  
**[Docker Compose Setup](https://github.com/Golem-Base/op-geth/blob/main/RUN_LOCALLY.md)**

Once it's running, use the local CLI tool like this:

```bash
go run ./cmd/golembase [command from the CLI docs above]
```

In this setup, the CLI will connect to your locally running services — perfect for development and debugging.

## 📘 Wish to learn more?

Golem Base introduces a novel architectural model for decentralized data infrastructure — designed to be modular, Ethereum-native, and accessible across both Web2 and Web3.

For a complete overview:

📄 **[Read the Litepaper (PDF)](https://golem-base.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GolemBase-Litepaper.pdf)**

It covers:
- The structure and role of DB-Chains  
- How Golem Base aligns with Ethereum Layer 2/3 philosophy  
- Potential real-world use cases
